## Introduction

**Beat Recommender 2** is a song recommendation web application created using Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and Spotify API. I wanted to update my beat-recommender project using Spotify API that I created with Create React App with the new technology I have learned so I worked on this project. 
Referred to these awesome guides to learn about the use of Spotify API and Next.js. Target Users: spotify user's who enjoy finding music that they like based on recommendation. e.g. user's who enjoy the Discover weekly playlists on Spotify. 

It took 12 hours to develop from ideation to deployment for the first main features (authenticate user with Spotify, get top artists and genre from the user, and allow user to select up to 5 of those traits and submit those to spotify recommendation API and show results.)
1 hour to brainstorm and come up with the idea of a web application using Spotify API.
8 hours to development including research on Next.js, Spotify API integration, Tailwind CSS. 
1 hour to deployment, hosting, and continuous integration.
2 hours to user test and improve the user experience.

## Technologies
This project is created with, 
 - Next.js: "12.2.4"
 - React: "18.2.0""
 - React-DOM: "18.2.0",
 - Tailwind CSS: "^3.1.8",
 
## Setup

To try this project, go to 
https://beat-recommender2.vercel.app/

## Features
Following are the things that I have worked on and learned through working on this project. 

### Authentication using Authorization Code Flow and use of serverless api functions to handle keys to access third-party api's
Learned how the Authorization Code Flow works and how it requires a server for this structure (you don't want to expose your keys in the frontend) because of the use of symmetric keys such as client id and client secret keys. Also, learned how to do this using serverless api functions in Next.js. I learned how to use Next.js serverless api's to use keys (environmental variables saved on the server) to access third-party api's.

### Learned about session storage and use of different storage
Also, learned how to use sessions to save information that you don't want to show on the frontend (like access tokens on the server). 
These are some storage knowledge that I learned working on this project.
Client (non-private) - cookies (easy, quick, small, lasting until clear cookies), localstorage(easy, quick, large, lasting until clear cache) 
Server (private) - session (based on sessions, lasting until tab closed), files (small, until the server is unaccessible), database (large, until the server is unaccessible)

### Tailwind css
First time I used Tailwind css in my project. It took a while to get use to it but learned how it helps prototyping quickly. 
So cool that you can just write css as classes! 

### Deployment to Vercel 
I used Vercel to deploy and host this Next.js app. 

### Writing Custom Hooks
In order to use the Spotify Web Playback SDK and allow access to the player instance across the app, created my first custom hook which receives a callback function to get access token and then adds the spotify web player sdk script and initialize a player instance using the access token and returns information and updates about the state of the connected player instance through a combination of useState, useEffect, and useRef. The hook returns the player instance, information about whether the instance is ready to connect, and device id which is needed to use the web player api. 

Referred to this awesome repo for learning about how to write a custom hook for Spotify Web Player.

### AJAX
Uses fetch API and axios to make API requests to the Spotify API and Next.js APIs. 

## Upcoming Features (Updates!)
 - Custom Hooks
    Write custom hooks to call the serverless api functions to fetch information from third-parties with updates using useSWR. 
    
 - Global State Management
    Use of Context API or Redux to manage global state such as user information. 
    
 - Re-collecting the access token using refresh tokens
    Write the logic to use refresh tokens when the access token expires. 
    
 - Improve user experience
    Make sure that errors can be shown when there is a problem using try catch and showing those errors in error messages.
    Add validation to the selected favorite artists and genres (e.g. show error when there is more than 5 selected). 
 
 ## New Features
 - Feature to try and play the song without leaving the web app. 
   Integration of Spotify Web Playback SDK. 

 - You can add the songs to the playlist from the web app.
